Jimi - Django eCommerce solution without bells and whistles

This project is very much in its beginnings. When it is ready for production it will be a basic Django eCommerce app (web shop) without bells and whistles (although easy to understand and expand for other needs). Some features I am focusing on are:

- A simple but elegant tree model for product catalog
- A simple but powerful shopping cart
- Simple and elegant stock keeping
- Powerful pricing and discount possibilities

I develop this for a real-world web shop and it's very concrete needs. Some inspiration comes from [Satchmo](http://www.satchmoproject.com/) (of course) and [RoR-e](http://ror-e.com/).
